Here are the existing test scenarios for the function, which are not considered while generating test cases 
undefined:
  [
    test_addition_of_two_positive_integers,
    test_addition_of_two_negative_integers,
    test_addition_of_positive_and_negative_integer,
    test_addition_with_zero,
    test_addition_of_large_integers,
    test_addition_leading_to_overflow
  ]
Certainly! Below are well-thought-out test scenarios for the `addition` function, excluding the already created test cases:

### Scenario 1: Addition of Two Zeroes
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_zeroes
  Description: Verify that adding two zero values correctly results in zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: num1 and num2 are both set to 0.
  Act: Invoke the addition function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's correctness when handling the lowest neutral values, ensuring that the addition logic correctly interprets zero values.

### Scenario 2: Addition of a Positive Integer and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_positive_integer_and_zero
  Description: Ensure that adding zero to a positive integer returns the same positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: num1 is set to a positive integer and num2 is set to 0.
  Act: Call the addition function with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the result equals the positive integer.
Validation:
  This test confirms the identity property of addition, where adding zero to any number should not change the number.

### Scenario 3: Addition of a Negative Integer and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_negative_integer_and_zero
  Description: Ensure that adding zero to a negative integer returns the same negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: num1 is set to a negative integer and num2 is set to 0.
  Act: Call the addition function with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the result equals the negative integer.
Validation:
  Similar to the previous test, this verifies the identity property of addition for negative numbers, ensuring consistent behavior across different numeric signs.

### Scenario 4: Addition of Two Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_floats
  Description: Test the addition of two floating-point numbers and check for correct floating-point arithmetic.
Execution:
  Arrange: num1 and num2 are set to floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the addition function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is close to the expected floating-point sum using an appropriate precision level.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle floating-point arithmetic, which is crucial for applications requiring fractional numbers.

### Scenario 5: Addition Resulting in a Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_resulting_in_negative
  Description: Confirm that the addition of a smaller positive number and a larger negative number results in the correct negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: num1 is a small positive integer, and num2 is a larger negative integer.
  Act: Call the addition function with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the result is negative and correctly calculated.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's correctness when the sum of inputs crosses over the zero boundary, which can be critical in financial or scientific calculations where sign correctness is crucial.

### Scenario 6: Addition of Two Extremely Small Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_small_floats
  Description: Verify that the function can handle the addition of two very small floating-point numbers without precision loss.
Execution:
  Arrange: num1 and num2 are set to very small floating-point values.
  Act: Call the addition function with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that the result is accurately calculated considering floating-point precision limits.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the precision and reliability of the addition function when dealing with very small numbers, which is important in fields like scientific computing where precision is paramount. 

These scenarios expand the test coverage by considering various numeric combinations and properties, ensuring robust verification of the `addition` function's correctness and reliability.
