ROOST_METHOD_HASH=addition_9ccff787e3
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addition_77ffd3333b


Scenario 1: Test for Valid Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly adds two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function passing two positive integers.
  Assert: Check if the output is the correct sum of the two integers.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as this is the basic functionality of the addition function and it should work correctly with positive integers. 

Scenario 2: Test for Valid Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function passing two negative integers.
  Assert: Check if the output is the correct sum of the two integers.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as the addition function should correctly add negative integers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly adds any integer with zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function passing one integer and zero.
  Assert: Check if the output is equal to the integer.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as the addition function should return the same integer when added with zero.

Scenario 4: Test for Decimal Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_decimals
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly adds two decimal numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function passing two decimal numbers.
  Assert: Check if the output is the correct sum of the two decimals.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as the addition function should be able to handle and correctly add decimal numbers.

Scenario 5: Test for Very Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly adds two very large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function passing two very large numbers.
  Assert: Check if the output is the correct sum of the two large numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as the addition function should be able to handle and correctly add very large numbers.
