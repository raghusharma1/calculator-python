```
Scenario 1: Test the addition of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct addition of two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive numbers.
  Act: Invoke the addition function, passing the two positive numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly performs addition for positive numbers, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Test the addition of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct addition of two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative numbers.
  Act: Invoke the addition function, passing the two negative numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly performs addition for negative numbers, following the rules of arithmetic.

Scenario 3: Test the addition of a positive number and a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_positive_and_negative_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct addition of a positive number and a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive number and a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the addition function, passing the positive and negative numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly performs addition when the numbers are of different signs, following the rules of arithmetic.

Scenario 4: Test the addition of zero and a number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_zero_and_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct addition of zero and a number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and a number.
  Act: Invoke the addition function, passing zero and the number as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the number.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly returns the number when zero is one of the operands, as per the rules of arithmetic.

Scenario 5: Test the addition of two floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_float_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct addition of two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two floating-point numbers.
  Act: Invoke the addition function, passing the two floating-point numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly performs addition for floating-point numbers, as per the function's specifications and following the rules of arithmetic.
