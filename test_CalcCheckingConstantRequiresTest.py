Scenario 1: Test for constant output
Details:
  TestName: test_checking_constant_output
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function always returns the constant value '1', regardless of the input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function is stateless and does not depend on any external resources.
  Act: The function will be invoked with two random numbers as parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1', and this will be checked by comparing the function's output to '1'.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test is important because the function's specification states that it should always return '1'. Thus, if it returns anything else, it is not working as intended.

Scenario 2: Test with zero as input
Details:
  TestName: test_checking_constant_output_with_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function still returns '1' even when one or both of the inputs are '0'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function is stateless and does not depend on any external resources.
  Act: The function will be invoked with '0' and another random number as parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1', and this will be checked by comparing the function's output to '1'.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks that the function handles '0' input correctly. According to the function's specification, it should always return '1', so if it returns anything else when given '0' as input, it is not working as intended.

Scenario 3: Test with negative numbers as input
Details:
  TestName: test_checking_constant_output_with_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function still returns '1' even when one or both of the inputs are negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function is stateless and does not depend on any external resources.
  Act: The function will be invoked with a negative number and another random number as parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1', and this will be checked by comparing the function's output to '1'.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks that the function handles negative number input correctly. According to the function's specification, it should always return '1', so if it returns anything else when given a negative number as input, it is not working as intended.
