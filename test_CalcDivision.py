Scenario 1: Test for the division of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_two_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct division of two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive numbers.
  Act: Invoke the division function, passing the two positive numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned result matches the expected quotient of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can correctly divide two positive numbers, which is a basic requirement for any division function.

Scenario 2: Test for the division of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_two_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct division of two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative numbers.
  Act: Invoke the division function, passing the two negative numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned result matches the expected quotient of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can correctly divide two negative numbers. The function should return a positive number as dividing two negatives results in a positive.

Scenario 3: Test for the division of a positive number by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_positive_number_by_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's handling of division by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive number and zero.
  Act: Invoke the division function, passing the positive number and zero as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function correctly handles the division by zero error case, which is a common pitfall in division operations.

Scenario 4: Test for the division of zero by a positive number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_zero_by_positive_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct division of zero by a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and a positive number.
  Act: Invoke the division function, passing zero and the positive number as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is zero.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can correctly divide zero by a positive number, which should always result in zero.

Scenario 5: Test for the division of a positive number by a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_positive_number_by_negative_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct division of a positive number by a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive number and a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the division function, passing the positive number and the negative number as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a negative number.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly divide a positive number by a negative number, which should always result in a negative number.
