Test generated by RoostGPT for test calculatortest using AI Type  and AI Model 




### Scenario 1: Addition of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_positive_integers
  Description: Test whether the addition function correctly adds two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two positive integers, e.g., addition(5, 7).
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers, which should be 12 in this case.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function performs basic arithmetic addition correctly and returns the expected result when using typical positive integer inputs.

### Scenario 2: Addition of two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_negative_integers
  Description: Test whether the addition function correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two negative integers, e.g., addition(-5, -3).
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers, which should be -8 in this case.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly add negative integers, which is critical for applications dealing with ranges of negative numeric values.

### Scenario 3: Addition of a positive and a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_positive_and_negative_integer
  Description: Test whether the addition function correctly adds a positive integer to a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call the addition function with a positive and a negative integer, e.g., addition(10, -2).
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers, which should be 8 in this case.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to correctly handle and return the correct sum when one operand is positive and the other is negative, which is a common real-world scenario.

### Scenario 4: Addition of zero with another number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zero
  Description: Test whether adding zero to another number returns the other number unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call the addition function with zero and another number, e.g., addition(0, 5).
  Assert: Check that the result is the same as the non-zero number, which should be 5 in this case.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function complies with the identity property of zero in addition, which is fundamental in arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 5: Addition of two very large integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_large_integers
  Description: Test whether the function can handle and correctly add two very large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two very large integers, e.g., addition(999999999, 888888888).
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum of these numbers, which should be 1888888887 in this case.
Validation:
  This test checks the functionâ€™s capability to handle large integer values without overflow, ensuring reliability in high-value computations.

### Scenario 6: Addition leading to an integer overflow
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_leading_to_overflow
  Description: Test the behavior when the addition of two integers results in a value that exceeds the maximum integer limit.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two integers that together exceed the maximum limit, e.g., addition(sys.maxsize, 1).
  Assert: Check how the function handles the overflow scenario.
Validation:
  This test is important to understand how the function behaves under overflow conditions, even though Python typically handles large integers gracefully by switching to long integers.
